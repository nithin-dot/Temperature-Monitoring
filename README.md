# Temperature-monitoring

A Beta Project which Developed During My college Days In the Pandemic It Is Complex Task To Monitor Every Student 
So We Implement DashBoard Which has a Pool of Student Data Like Temperature Low and High with Color Representation and Student Exit and Entry Time during Academic which Will be Displayed on One Screen 

## How it works

   -   Student Temperature is Recorded by Temperature Sensor which is Fixed at Entry and Exit point of the College Along with RFID which records the Student Presence Using ID Card 
   - The data Recorded Will be Stored In Database Here we Used SQL for Structured data
   - The Data  Stored In the Database Will be Retrieve through Node.js API to Angular DashBoard 
   - In Angular, We Use Petite Condition Statement For temperature Color Representation
